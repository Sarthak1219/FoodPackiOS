/**
UserLocation class is a helper class for map views.
Uses NSObject and CLLocationManagerDelegate protocols to allow updates to user location and view.
 Uses ObservableOject Protocol and @published so map views auto update when user's location changes and routes have been calculated
 Maintains an instance of a locationManager, which allows access to the user's location.
 Maintains the user's current location as it is updated.
 Maintains a dictionary of routes calculated to given restaurants.
 Includes methods for calculating routes (added to dictionary) and getting a route given the restaurant.
