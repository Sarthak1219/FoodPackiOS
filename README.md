FoodPack iOS App for Volunteers in FoodPack Program.

App gets data from MySQL DataBase -using a PHP script- containing information about Restaurants, including location and inventory message. 

Home screen shows a list of all Restaurants with toggle for displaying all or just those waiting for pickup (Red is ready for pickup, Gray is not).
