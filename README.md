# FoodPackiOS
The FoodPack program idea is a system where restuarants can request pickup for excess food to be delivered to nearby partner organizations, such as Food Pantries, Food Banks, etc.

FoodPack iOS App for Volunteers in FoodPack Program allows them to view pending requests, accept, and get directions.

App gets data from MySQL DataBase -using a PHP script- containing information about Restaurants, including location and inventory message. 

Home screen shows a list of all Restaurants with toggle for displaying all or just those waiting for pickup (Red is ready for pickup, Gray is not).
